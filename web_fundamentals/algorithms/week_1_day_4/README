Program Start
Call function (name isPal)
array = isPal
Create a for loop 
var left = 0
if left is less than array lenght divided by 2, proceed to next step
var right = arr.length-1-left
create an if statement 
check that array left does not equal array right --> return "Not a pal-indrome!"
Once left is not less than arr.length divided by 2 --> return "Pal-indrome!"
Run line 45 after function isPal is complete
set var result1 to isPal and return result1
set var result2 to isPal and return result2
